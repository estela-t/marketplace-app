# Marketplace App

A simple app that allows a user to view some products, search them, view the details of each product, and select to compare multiple products.

Uses the vite-react template:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

## To run locally:

- have Node installed (recommended v18.15.0^)
